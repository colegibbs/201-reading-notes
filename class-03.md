## HTML & CSS

### Chapter 3: Lists

#### Ordered Lists

- ordered lists are created using `<ol>`
- the items in the list should be put in the `<ls>` tag
- lists should be styled in CSS though the numbering can be changed in html

`<ol>`
  `<ls>`list item`</ls>`
  `<ls>`list item`</ls>`
`<ol>`

#### Unordered List

- unordered list are created with `<ul>`
- each item in the list is made using `<ls>`, just like an ordered list
- lists should be styled in css

`<ul>`
  `<ls>`list item`</ls>`
  `<ls>`list item`</ls>`
`</ul>`

#### Definition Lists

- created with `<dl>`
- usually is made up of a list of terms
- `<dt>` is used for the definition term or the word that is to be defined
- `<dd>` is used to contain the defintion

`<dl>`
  `<dt>`definiton term`<dt>`
  `<dd>`term definition`<dd>`
  `<dt>`definiton term`<dt>`
  `<dd>`term definition`<dd>`
`</dl>`

#### Nested List

- you can put a list inside of an `<ls>` to create a nested list

#### Take Aways

- ordered, unordered, and definition lists
- ordered lists use numbers
- unordered lsits use bullets
- definition lists are for definitions
- lists can be nested
